Please check the following stacks installed on the server.

1. Symfony CLI version v4.18.4 (c) 2017-2020 Symfony SAS

Please follow the steps to use this Symfony CLI app

1. Go to the folder of an application (where you preferred)
2. Symfony new <application_name>
3. Go to application_name directory
4. Make sure that symfony/console 5.2.* component is installed in the application
5. Then run symfony console make: command gameResult
6. Then go to <application_name>/src/Command directory and find GameResultCommand.php file
7. Then copy the source code from the file GameResultCommand.txt (which I've attached here in zip of GameResultCommand) into the GameResultCommand.php
8. Then run symfony console gameResult command
9. Then provide the arguments as per asked questions in the console
10. Get the result as expected.

Note:

If you are using <application_name>/bin/ location to execute symfony as a CLI then use only symfony gameResult instead of symfony console gameResult
